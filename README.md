# Breast Cancer Prediction

## Overview

This project, named "Breast Cancer Prediction," focuses on predicting whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant. The prediction model is built using logistic regression from scikit-learn. The primary objective is to leverage machine learning to aid in the early detection of breast cancer.

## Why Logistic Regression?

Logistic regression is chosen for this breast cancer prediction task due to its effectiveness in binary classification problems. Given that the target variable is whether a tumor is benign or malignant (a binary outcome), logistic regression is well-suited for such scenarios. Additionally, logistic regression provides probabilities, making it easier to interpret and explain the results.

## Usage

Open the `model.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and understand the steps involved in training and evaluating the breast cancer prediction model.

Feel free to use and modify the code for your own datasets or extend the functionality as needed.
